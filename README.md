The original was hosted on http://blogs.msdn.com/paulwh/archive/2007/05/04/addressaccessdeniedexception-http-could-not-register-url-http-8080.aspx but has disappeared and I haven't been able to find it, or newer versions, anymore. [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20070906205843/http://blogs.msdn.com/paulwh/archive/2007/05/04/addressaccessdeniedexception-http-could-not-register-url-http-8080.aspx) can help us out a little. My attempts to track Paul Wheeler down to contact him about licensing and such have failed until now; if anyone can help me get into contact that would be much appreciated! Since the original code came with a warning and disclaimer I'll repeat it here:
